# To take an exponential of a number
#print(2**3) #8

#Computers store numbers in binary (base 2), 
# but some decimal fractions, like 0.1 and 0.2,
#  do not have exact binary representations. 
# Instead, they are approximated, leading to small rounding errors.
# To handle this kind of issues, round() function often use by programmers.

# Python has 'dynamic typing' - This cause same pros and also some cons.
